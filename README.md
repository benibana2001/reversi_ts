## TLDL
This Repository Is Like A Reversi Game.

I'm Developing This Repository As Only Teaching Myself How To Create Game Using "TypeScript" + "Webpack" From Scratch.

This Is Only My Studying.

### Why Don't Use FrameWork?
Exactly, There Are Some FrameWorks For Creating WebApp (React, Vue.js, Angular ...) And Some Game FrameWorkd/Engine (Phaser, Enchant.js ... ), And When If You Develop Some Apps, Using These is A Better Solution. 

But I Feel Weired Unless Knowing These FrameWork's Internal System, So That :D

This System Is Based On [JavaScriptで作るリバーシゲーム | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-reversi/) Which Is A Lesson How To Create Reversi Using JavaScript(ES5 + jQuery).

I Learned How To Create Reversi Took This Lesson, And [Re Developed Using ES6 Native(not using jQuery)](https://github.com/benibana2001/geme_es6).
But I Would Develop More Suitable Way, So Created This Repository.
